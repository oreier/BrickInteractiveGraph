# Brick Interactive Graph

Brick is an open-source ontology which describes, defines and contextualizes data sources in and around buildings. Brick standardizes semantic description of physical, virtual and logical entities and assets and the relationships between them. Brick facilitates the implementation of self-adapting data-driven software — software which can configure itself to operate in a particular setting — by enabling that software to query its environment and discover relevant data sources.

This WebApp is a interactive graph, that allows a user to learn and find crucial details about building parts or relationships.
