# BrickUI2

Brick is an open-source ontology which describes, defines and contextualizes data sources in and around buildings. Brick standardizes semantic description of physical, virtual and logical entities and assets and the relationships between them. Brick facilitates the implementation of self-adapting data-driven software — software which can configure itself to operate in a particular setting — by enabling that software to query its environment and discover relevant data sources.

This UI is a interactive graph query builder, that allows a user to utilize the Brick Ontology linked with a database, to query building systems and find crucial details about building parts or relationships.
